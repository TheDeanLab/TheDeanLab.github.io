The Dean Lab is a multi-disciplinary team of biologists, chemists, physicists, and engineers
at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. We develop
advanced microscopy technologies to study cellular signaling processes in
complex tissue contexts. Our goal is to understand how cells make decisions in the context
of their native environment, and how these decisions go awry in disease. More information
about our research can be found on our `website <https://www.dean-lab.org>`_.

**Projects**
=============

- Light-sheet microscopy software packages for intelligent imaging of complex tissue samples

- Tissue clearing and labeling protocols for high-resolution imaging deep within
  biological specimens.

- Cost-effective, easy-to-assemble, and performant light-sheet microscopes for interrogating live cells,
  expanded, and cleared tissue samples.

**Software Repositories**
================

.. _navigate_repo:

- `navigate <https://github.com/TheDeanLab/navigate>`_ - A Python package for intelligent light-sheet microscopy of complex tissue samples.
- `navigate_plugin_template <https://github.com/TheDeanLab/navigate-plugin-template>`_ - A template repository for creating plugins for the **navigate** package.
